# Course Notes Repository

## Overview
This repository contains all of my course notes from various subjects and courses. The notes are primarily stored in Microsoft OneNote package format (`.onepkg`), which allows for easy organization and review.


## Repository Structure
The notes are organized by subject and course name. Each course has its own folder containing the relevant `.onepkg` file and/or any other supplementary materials.
